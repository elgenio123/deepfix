"""DeepFix Knowledge Base - Knowledge retrieval system for AI agents.

This package provides a unified knowledge retrieval system that combines:
- Web Search (Tavily): Real-time web information
- AI Research (Perplexity Sonar): Synthesized analysis with citations
- Local KB (LlamaIndex): Domain-specific ML/DL knowledge

Example:
    >>> from deepfix_kb import KnowledgeBridge
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize the bridge
    >>> bridge = KnowledgeBridge()
    >>>
    >>> # Direct query
    >>> response = await bridge.query("How to fix gradient vanishing?")
    >>> print(response.synthesis)
