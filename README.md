DeepFix is an AI agent assistant that automatically diagnoses common bugs in machine learning and provides a prioritized list of solutions backed by industry/research best practices. It integrates directly into ML workflows.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Bug Detection**: Identifies common ML issues automatically
- **Prioritized Solutions**: Get ranked suggestions based on best practices
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly works with PyTorch Lightning and MLflow
- **Research-Backed**: Solutions are grounded in industry standards and research
- **Multi-Artifact Analysis**: Analyzes datasets, model checkpoints, training logs, and deepchecks reports

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/delcaux-labs/deepfix.git
cd deepfix

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv venv --python 3.11
uv pip install -e .
```

See the [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md) for detailed instructions and Docker deployment.

### Basic Usage

```python
from deepfix_sdk.client import DeepFixClient
from deepfix_sdk.zoo.datasets.foodwaste import load_train_and_val_datasets
from deepfix_sdk.data.datasets import ImageClassificationDataset

# Start server (in separate terminal)
# uv run deepfix-server launch -e deepfix-server/.env -port 8844

# Initialize client
client = DeepFixClient(api_url="http://localhost:8844", timeout=120)

# Load and wrap dataset
dataset_name = "cafetaria-foodwaste"
train_data, val_data = load_train_and_val_datasets(
    image_size=448, batch_size=8, num_workers=4, pin_memory=False
)
train_data = ImageClassificationDataset(dataset_name=dataset_name, dataset=train_data)
val_data = ImageClassificationDataset(dataset_name=dataset_name, dataset=val_data)

# Diagnose dataset
result = client.get_diagnosis(
    train_data=train_data,
    test_data=val_data,
    batch_size=8,
    language="english",
)

print(result.to_text())
```

For more examples, see the [Quickstart Guide](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md).
